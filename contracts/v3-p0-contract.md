# V3 P0 Cross-Repo Contract (Frozen)

> **Status: FROZEN for P0 — deliverable of V3-001.** This is the single contract

> field defined here.

## 1. Scope and relationship to existing surfaces

P0 delivers three bounded capabilities (V3_SPEC §16):

1. **Purchase decision** — structured Should I Buy judgment grounded in the
   user's real wardrobe (V3-003 … V3-010).
2. **Avatar profile** — consent-gated person reference built from naturally
   produced photos (V3-011 … V3-015, V3-021).
3. **Static try-on preview** — one on-demand L2 static full-outfit preview per
   decision (V3-016 … V3-020).

**Additive-only rules (frozen):**

- `POST /v1/shopping/sense-check` and `GET /v1/shopping/history` (M17) stay
  untouched in P0. All V3 endpoints are new surfaces — with one deliberate
  exception: `GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}` is the **existing M10
  outfit-board polling endpoint**, extended additively (§6.2); it is never
  re-gated or re-shaped. Nothing existing is removed, renamed or re-shaped.
- `outfit_visual_assets` is **extended with additive, nullable columns**
  (V3_SPEC §11.3); no existing column changes meaning. Migrations are additive
  and reversible.
- No new navigation tab. V3 entries appear only inside existing surfaces
  (Outfit Detail, Ask answer actions, Should I Buy result, Profile data
  controls) per V3_SPEC §3.3 / §4.
- V2 core paths (Today, import-to-first-outfit, Ask) must be byte-identical in
  behavior while every V3 flag is off.

## 2. Feature flags

Convention: pydantic-settings `ENABLE_*` booleans in
`app/config/settings.py`, **all default `False`** (existing repo convention).

| Flag | Gates | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_V3_PURCHASE_DECISION` | `/v1/purchase-candidates*`, `/v1/wardrobe-decisions/{id}` | — |
| `ENABLE_V3_AVATAR` | `/v1/avatar-profile*`, `/v1/avatar-candidates/*/consent` | — |
| `ENABLE_V3_STATIC_TRYON` | `POST /v1/wardrobe-decisions/{id}/visual-preview`, `POST /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}/feedback` — **new surfaces only**; the existing `GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}` (M10) stays ungated | `ENABLE_V3_AVATAR` |

**Rollback semantics (frozen):**

1. Flag off ⇒ every gated endpoint raises
   `FriendlyException(error_codes.FORBIDDEN /* 4003 */, "<feature> is not enabled", status_code=503)`
   — identical to the existing `ENABLE_PACKING_LIST` gate.
2. FE: every V3 surface is an **optional, self-hiding** entry — on a 503 from
   its probe/query it hides silently (existing `src/api/client.ts` convention
   for feature-flagged cards). No toast, no retry loop, no placeholder.
3. Data written while a flag was on **persists** when the flag turns off
   (`ShoppingSenseCheck` M17 precedent: the flag gates exposure only). Turning
   a flag back on restores function with no migration.
4. If `ENABLE_V3_STATIC_TRYON` flips off with jobs in flight: running jobs
   finish or fail normally, no new jobs enqueue, and cached assets remain
   readable via the existing ungated `GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}`.
   Flag state must never affect that GET — V2 outfit-board polling depends
   on it (§1 additive-only rules).
5. `ENABLE_V3_STATIC_TRYON=true` with `ENABLE_V3_AVATAR=false` is an invalid
   configuration: BE fails at startup via the settings `model_validator`
   (`"ENABLE_V3_STATIC_TRYON requires ENABLE_V3_AVATAR"`), matching the
   existing `ENABLE_PACKING_PLANNER requires ENABLE_PACKING_LIST` precedent.

## 3. Wire conventions

- JSON wire format is **snake_case**; FE maps to camelCase inside `src/api/*`
  (existing convention, e.g. `push_enabled` → `pushEnabled`).
- Success responses are plain Pydantic response models (HTTP 200/202).
  Errors use the unified envelope `{code, message, data}` produced by the
  exception middleware. No new top-level error codes: reuse
  `4001 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `4002 UNAUTHORIZED`, `4003 FORBIDDEN`,
  `4041 NOT_FOUND`, `4091 STATE_CONFLICT`, `5001 INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- Resources that exist but are not owned by the caller return `NOT_FOUND`
  (no existence leak).
- All IDs are UUID strings. All timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC.
- Image URLs in responses are **short-lived signed URLs**, never persisted by
  the client (V3_SPEC §13.5).

**Version-skew rule (frozen):** FE must degrade safely on unknown values —
unknown `avatar_status` ⇒ treat as `disabled` (hide avatar entries); unknown
`generation_status` ⇒ treat as `failed` (show the standard no-result fallback);
unknown `decision` ⇒ render server-provided texts without decision-specific
styling or actions. A response missing an optional V3 block means "feature not
available", never an error.

## 4. Avatar contract

### 4.1 `avatar_status` state machine (frozen enum)

```text
none                  no candidate material
candidate             qualified material exists, not yet consented
preparing             consented; canonical reference assets being generated
ready                 usable for static try-on
refresh_recommended   usable; a newer/better source is suggested
disabled              user revoked or switched off
```

Transitions: `none→candidate` (quality check passes on a natural photo),
`candidate→preparing` (explicit consent), `preparing→ready` (preparation job
succeeds), `preparing→candidate` (preparation fails; source stays consentable),
`ready→refresh_recommended` (system suggestion only, never a nag),
`any→disabled` (revoke), `disabled→preparing` (user re-enables via new consent).

### 4.2 Endpoints

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/avatar-profile` | Current profile state. `status=none` is a normal 200, not 404. |
| `POST /v1/avatar-candidates/{source_asset_id}/consent` | Accept or decline one candidate. |
| `POST /v1/avatar-profile/uploads` | Register a deliberately uploaded full-body photo (source C). Reuses the existing presign upload flow; body carries the uploaded asset reference. |
| `POST /v1/avatar-profile/prepare` | Start preparation from a consented source. |
| `POST /v1/avatar-profile/replace` | Prepare a new version; atomic swap on success. |
| `DELETE /v1/avatar-profile?purge_derived=<bool>` | Disable and delete. `purge_derived` is **required** (no default): `true` also deletes generated try-on assets derived from any avatar version. |

**The two `purge_derived` values are V3_SPEC §15's two Profile controls** (V3-021
clarification; no shape change). §15 requires Profile to offer 停止用于生成 and
删除形象参考及派生结果 as separate controls, and the difference between them is
exactly what this parameter decides — only the second item names 派生结果:

| §15 Profile control | Call | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 停止用于生成 (disable / revoke) | `?purge_derived=false` | Profile → `disabled`; version and source-asset rows deleted, their objects purged out of band. New generation is refused immediately (`avatar_not_ready`). Previews already generated stay readable, so past decisions keep their evidence (§4.3). |
| 删除形象参考及派生结果 (delete) | `?purge_derived=true` | The above **plus** the `static_tryon` assets and their objects. |

Both branches delete the source photo, so both are followed by `status=disabled`
with no material — which is why re-setup goes through a new photo and a new
consent, not through an undo. That is the frozen `disabled → preparing` edge, and
§4.2's `candidate` block is what makes it reachable (see below).

`GET /v1/avatar-profile` response (frozen shape):

```jsonc
{
  "status": "none|candidate|preparing|ready|refresh_recommended|disabled",
  "active_version": {            // null unless status is ready/refresh_recommended
    "id": "uuid",
    "created_at": "ts",
    "canonical_front_url": "signed-url"
  },
  "candidate": {                 // null unless material awaits a consent
                                 // decision; null while status is preparing
    "source_asset_id": "uuid",
    "source_type": "ootd_photo|outfit_import|user_upload|camera_capture",
    "preview_url": "signed-url"
  },
  "consent": {                   // null until first consent
    "version": "string",         // consent copy version, audit-relevant
    "consented_at": "ts"
  }
}
```

`POST …/consent` body: `{"accept": true|false}`.
`accept=false` dismisses that candidate permanently — the same asset is never
re-prompted (V3_SPEC §7.3). `accept=true` requires the consent copy version in
`{"accept": true, "consent_version": "string"}` and moves the profile to
`preparing`.

Conflict rules: `prepare`/`replace` while a preparation job is running ⇒
`4091 STATE_CONFLICT`. `replace` failure keeps the previous version active —
there is never a gap where a ready avatar silently disappears.

**When `candidate` is populated** (V3-021 clarification; the block's *shape* is
unchanged and no new endpoint or state edge is introduced). It reports whatever
material is awaiting a consent decision — `quality_status=passed` and
`consent_status=pending` — for every status except `preparing`. Restricting it to
`status=candidate` made two frozen paths unreachable from any client, because in
both of them the profile deliberately does not move to `candidate`:

- **`disabled → preparing`** ("user re-enables via new consent"). A
  user-initiated preview request assesses a new photo for a revoked profile and
  leaves the status at `disabled` — there is no `disabled → candidate` edge, and
  moving would erase the revocation timestamp. The material qualified and its
  `source_asset_id` was known; nothing could read it.
- **`replace` from a new photo.** A profile with a live version stays `ready`
  through a new consent on purpose, so a working avatar is not withdrawn for a
  preparation that might fail.

`preparing` reports null because a second preparation is refused by the conflict
rule above, so a consent taken there could not be acted on.

Reporting the block is not prompting with it: the passive candidate sheet still
gates on `status=candidate` (V3_SPEC §7.3 — no repeated asking), so a `ready` or
`disabled` profile is never nagged. Only surfaces the user opened themselves —
Profile's avatar controls (V3-021) and the on-demand setup (V3-015) — read it.

### 4.3 Consent boundaries (frozen minimums)

- Consent is a **separate explicit action per source asset**; importing
  clothes never implies person-reference consent (source B rule, V3_SPEC §7.1).
- Revoke (`disabled`) immediately blocks new generation; existing decisions
  remain readable.
- Final consent/privacy copy is a **human gate** — implementation uses
  placeholder copy keys, and shipping copy requires explicit human approval.

## 5. Purchase decision contract

### 5.1 Endpoints

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/purchase-candidates` | Create a candidate from a link/screenshot/order image. |
| `GET /v1/purchase-candidates/{id}` | Poll parsing state. |
| `POST /v1/purchase-candidates/{id}/decision` | Produce (or return the existing) structured decision. |
| `GET /v1/wardrobe-decisions/{id}` | Replay a decision from its immutable snapshots. |

### 5.2 Candidate

`POST /v1/purchase-candidates` body (exactly one source reference):

```jsonc
{
  "source_type": "share_link|screenshot|order_image|ask_link",
  "source_url": "https://…",     // for share_link / ask_link
  "source_asset_id": "object_key" // for screenshot / order_image (presign upload)
}
```

**`source_asset_id` is the presign `object_key` string, not a uuid** (amended in
V3-004; this document previously typed it `uuid`). This service has no generic
asset table — `POST /v1/uploads/presign` returns a stable `object_key` plus a
TTL-bound `file_url`, so the object key *is* the asset reference and is the
column `purchase_candidates.source_object_key` persists (V3-003). The key must
sit under the caller's own `users/<user_id>/` prefix; anything else answers 404,
not 403, so the response cannot probe which keys exist (§3). Nothing signed is
ever persisted.

Response / `GET` shape: `{"id", "status", "parsed_item"}` with
`status: "submitted|parsed|parse_failed"` (frozen enum). Parsing may complete
synchronously or async; FE polls `GET` until terminal. `parse_failed` still
allows a decision request — the decision then returns `insufficient_information`
with a clarifying reason instead of a hard error (graceful degradation).

As implemented in V3-004 parsing is **synchronous**, so `POST` already returns a
terminal `parsed` or `parse_failed` and `submitted` is not observable through
this endpoint; the value stays in the frozen enum for a later async parse. FE
(V3-008) must therefore treat polling as optional-and-usually-unnecessary rather
than build a loop that expects a non-terminal state — but it must still handle
`submitted`, and any unknown status, without spinning forever (§3 version-skew
rule).

`parsed_item` (frozen minimal shape, all fields nullable):

```jsonc
{
  "category": "string",
  "colors": ["string"],
  "silhouette": "string",
  "material_hints": ["string"],
  "price": "string",
  "scene_tags": ["string"]
}
```

### 5.3 Decision

`POST …/{id}/decision` body: `{"concern": "volume|color|redundancy|scene|none"}`
(optional, default `none`). Repeated calls for the same candidate return the
existing decision (idempotent) unless the wardrobe changed materially — P0 may
simply always return the first decision.

`wardrobe_decision` response (frozen shape):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "candidate_id": "uuid",
  "decision": "worth_adding|consider_alternate|wait|avoid_duplicate|insufficient_information",
  "decision_text": "string",           // display copy; FE never synthesizes it
  "reasons": [                          // 2–3, ordered by importance
    {
      "kind": "redundancy|compatibility|scene_coverage|extra_purchase_needed|adoption_history",
      "text": "string"
    }
  ],
  "closet_comparison": {
    "summary_text": "string",
    "similar_items": [
      { "item_id": "uuid", "image_url": "signed-url", "relation": "covers|complements" }
    ]
  },
  "uncertainty": "low|medium|high",
  "visual_need": "none|helpful|recommended",   // drives preview entry weight
  "boundary_note": "string",                    // fixed copy: not a size/fit guarantee
  "next_actions": ["add_to_candidates","skip","recheck_color","style_with_existing"],
  "created_at": "ts"
}
```

Frozen rules:

- Enum literals in this document are adopted **verbatim from the immutable
  acceptance criteria in `feature_list.json`** (V3-007 decision states,
  V3-020 feedback verdicts), which outrank this contract in the workspace
  authority order. `visual_need: "none"` is the "visual need is false" state
  V3-007 requires; `helpful|recommended` only grade the entry weight.
- `decision` has exactly these five states — **no numeric suitability score**
  (V3_SPEC §5.4).
- `context_snapshot` and `evidence_snapshot` are persisted server-side at
  decision time; `GET /v1/wardrobe-decisions/{id}` replays from snapshots so
  later wardrobe changes never rewrite an old explanation.
- The full no-avatar experience is complete: nothing in this shape depends on
  avatar or visual preview. `visual_need` only *suggests* whether a preview
  entry is worth showing.

As implemented in V3-007 (clarifications, no shape change):

- The endpoint answers **HTTP 200**, never 201, because the second call returns
  the first decision — a created-status would be wrong half the time (§3 allows
  200/202). The request body is **optional**: an omitted body means
  `concern: "none"`, and an unrecognized `concern` is a 422.
- Idempotency is enforced by the unique index on `wardrobe_decisions.candidate_id`,
  so a repeated POST replays the stored snapshot and **ignores a new `concern`**.
  P0 never re-decides a candidate.
- `reasons[].kind` may be any of the five frozen values, but P0 emits four:
  **`adoption_history` is not produced yet** (no loaded projection carries wear
  counts). FE must tolerate it without building a surface that depends on it.
- `closet_comparison.similar_items[].image_url` is signed at read time and is
  **nullable** — an item with no image, or a storage outage, renders `null`
  rather than failing the decision. It is never persisted in the snapshot.
- `decision_text`, `reasons[].text`, `closet_comparison.summary_text` and
  `boundary_note` are server-rendered from templates in the user's resolved
  locale (`zh-CN` / `en-US`) and **frozen into the snapshot** at decision time,
  so a replayed decision keeps the wording — and the language — it was written
  with. There is no i18n key in this shape; the client renders the strings.

## 6. Static try-on preview contract

### 6.1 Endpoints

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/wardrobe-decisions/{id}/visual-preview` | New. Request (or fetch cached) static try-on for this decision. |
| `GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}` | **Existing M10 endpoint** (outfit-board polling), extended additively — never gated or re-shaped. |
| `POST /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}/feedback` | New. Record user fidelity feedback. |

`POST …/visual-preview` body (frozen):

```jsonc
{ "view_type": "static_tryon", "concern": "volume|color|length|overall", "consent": true }
```

BE selects supporting items (server-side outfit composition); FE submits no
open-ended styling state in P0 (V3_SPEC §12). Responses:

- Avatar not `ready`/`refresh_recommended` ⇒ `4091 STATE_CONFLICT`.
- Cache hit (see 6.3) ⇒ 200 with the existing asset, `generation_status`
  possibly already `ready`. Identical inputs never regenerate.
- Otherwise ⇒ 200 `{"asset_id": "uuid", "generation_status": "queued"}`.
- **Amended by V3-026 (additive, no new top-level code):** a refused admission
  ⇒ `4091 STATE_CONFLICT` at HTTP 429, with `data.reason` distinguishing
  `daily_budget_exhausted` (the per-user daily budget is spent; clears
  tomorrow) from `retry_budget_exhausted` (this generation has used its bounded
  retry allowance and will not be attempted again). FE must tell them apart
  because only one is a "come back later"; an unrecognized 429 reason degrades
  to the daily treatment, which under-promises finality rather than over-
  promising it.

### 6.2 `generation_status` lifecycle (frozen enum)

```text
queued → processing → quality_check → ready
                          │
                          ├→ failed                      (provider/technical error)
                          └→ rejected_by_quality_gate    (gate says: do not show)
```

`GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/{asset_id}` — the live M10 shape is kept
verbatim and only extended additively (frozen):

```jsonc
{
  "asset_id": "uuid",            // existing field name — NOT "id" (ios-api-alignment convention)
  "generation_status": "queued|processing|quality_check|ready|failed|rejected_by_quality_gate",
  "image_url": "signed-url",     // existing; null unless ready
  "visual_type": "static_tryon", // existing; new enum value for V3 assets
  "error_code": "string",        // existing; null unless failed
  "error_message": "string",     // existing; kept, null unless failed
  "created_at": "ts",            // ADDITIVE, nullable
  "expires_at": "ts"             // ADDITIVE, nullable
}
```

`quality_check` and `rejected_by_quality_gate` are **additive enum values** on
the existing `generation_status` field; FE versions that predate them degrade
per the §3 version-skew rule (unknown status → `failed`-equivalent display).

**Frozen degradation rule:** FE renders `rejected_by_quality_gate` with exactly
the same user-facing copy and layout as `failed` — the technical distinction is
never exposed. Both keep the decision result fully intact (V3_SPEC §3.6, §9.5).
Low-quality results are hidden, never shown.

Feedback body: `{"verdict": "looks_like_me|not_like_me|garment_wrong",
"aspects": ["face","body_ratio","garment_fit","color","other"]}` (aspects
optional).

As implemented in V3-024 (clarifications, no change to the frozen body):

- The endpoint answers **HTTP 200** on every accepted submission, including a
  repeat — the first tap and an identical re-tap describe the same recorded
  state, so a 201/200 split would make a retry look like a different outcome.
  Success shape (not previously frozen, so this is the definition):
  `{"asset_id": "uuid", "verdict": "…", "aspects": [...] | null,
  "recorded_at": "ts"}`. It deliberately carries **no** `provider` /
  `model_version` / `prompt_version` — §6.4 keeps that provenance internal, and
  the evaluation joins it server-side instead.
- `aspects` omitted and `aspects: []` stay distinct: "did not elaborate" is not
  "chose nothing". Submitted aspects are sorted and deduplicated server-side,
  so re-tap order can never register as a change of answer. Any value outside
  the two vocabularies — or any extra field, including a free-text comment — is
  **422** (`extra="forbid"`, the §5.2/V3-019 precedent).
- **404, three ways, one answer**: a missing asset, another user's asset, and
  the caller's own non-`static_tryon` asset are indistinguishable on the wire.
  The first two are §3's no-existence-leak rule; the third keeps this from
  becoming a generic image-feedback endpoint. `GET /v1/outfit-visual-assets/
  {asset_id}` stays ungated (§2) — only this POST is behind
  `ENABLE_V3_STATIC_TRYON`, which answers **503** when off, before the body is
  inspected.
- **One verdict per render, last write wins.** `static_preview_feedback` is
  unique on `asset_id`, and the write is an upsert onto it: an identical
  resubmission writes nothing at all (same row id, same `recorded_at`), and a
  *conflicting* resubmission replaces the stored verdict and moves
  `recorded_at`. This is §6.1's "either explicitly rejected or deterministically
  replace according to one documented rule" — replace is the rule, chosen
  because the client surface is fire-and-forget, so a rejection would be
  invisible to a user who believes their new answer was recorded.
- The BE emits **no** analytics event here. `v3_preview_feedback` is owned by
  **fe** (`docs/v3-analytics-events.md` §2), and a second emit would
  double-count every rate that reads it.

### 6.3 Idempotency, cache and cost (frozen)

- Strong cache key:
  `(avatar_version_id, normalized_candidate_asset_hash, sorted_supporting_item_ids, view_type, provider_model_version, prompt_version)`
  — same key ⇒ same asset, no regeneration (V3_SPEC §13.1).
- Job idempotency key: `static_tryon:{sha256(cache_key)}` following the
  existing `app/infrastructure/workers` job-runtime conventions.
- Automatic retry: **at most one** model retry after a quality-gate failure,
  then `rejected_by_quality_gate`. Generation runs under the existing
  `ENABLE_COST_GUARD` per-user-per-day quota mechanism.
- **Amended by V3-026:** that quota is admitted through a durable reservation
  taken before the job can become runnable, so a queued generation counts as
  paid usage (it did not before) and rapid sequential or concurrent requests
  cannot exceed the configured budget. Three budgets, deliberately distinct and
  named where they are enforced: the per-user **daily** budget
  (`ENABLE_COST_GUARD`), the **technical** attempt budget inside one admitted
  generation (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`), and the **revive** budget per generation
  (`TRYON_MAX_REVIVES`, unconditional — a safety bound, not a spending policy).
  A user-initiated revive is a new purchase and is refused once its allowance is
  spent. Internal accounting keeps a technical failure distinguishable from a
  quality-gate rejection; neither reaches a response (see 6.4).
- `visual_type` values added in P0: `static_tryon`, `avatar_canonical`
  (`outfit_multiview` is reserved for P1 and must not appear in P0 responses).

### 6.4 Provider ports (names frozen)

```text
AvatarPreparationPort
StaticTryOnPort
VisualQualityGatePort
MultiViewGenerationPort   (reserved, P1 — not implemented in P0)
```

Providers (MiniMax or others) are adapters behind these ports and never leak
into the domain contract or API responses. `provider`, `model_version`,
`prompt_version` are internal columns, not exposed to FE. Development and CI
use fake/recorded adapters only; any real-provider evaluation is a separately
budgeted, explicitly authorized task (V3-016, human gate). Real user photos
are never sent to third-party providers during development loops.

## 7. Privacy and logging boundaries (frozen minimums)

- Person photos are high-sensitivity assets: independent consent, visible
  status, replace, disable and delete controls in Profile (V3_SPEC §15).
- Logs and analytics must never contain image bytes, signed URLs, or body /
  identity inferences.
- No output may state or imply size or fit accuracy; every preview carries the
  fixed boundary note.
- No body-shape commentary of any kind (no slimming, age, attractiveness or
  "fix" language).

## 8. OpenAPI process (frozen)

- V3-001 introduces **no OpenAPI change**; `docs/openapi.json` stays
  byte-aligned FE↔BE (`./init.sh contract`).
- Every later BE feature that touches routers/schemas runs `make openapi` and
  copies `docs/openapi.{json,yaml}` to the FE repo **in the same feature**, so
  `./init.sh contract` is green at every merge point.
- Analytics/event schemas are defined by V3-002 and must not modify the API
  shapes frozen here.

## 9. P0 scope exclusions (frozen)

P0 explicitly excludes (V3_SPEC §16, §21): each item below is out of scope and
its absence is an acceptance criterion, not an omission.

| Excluded | Contract consequence |
|---|---|
| Multi-view / 360° / video | `view_type` accepts only `static_tryon`; `outfit_multiview` never appears. |
| 3D mesh / AR / cloth physics | No such fields or claims anywhere. |
| Size / fit accuracy claims | `boundary_note` mandatory; no fit scores exist in any shape. |
| Mandatory photo onboarding | All avatar acquisition is contextual and declinable; decline keeps the full decision experience. |
